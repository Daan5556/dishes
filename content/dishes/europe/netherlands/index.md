For the first dish of this challenge, I decided to make a dish from my home
country. I don't like Dutch food, so I never cooked this dish before in my life.
It had been a while since I ate this when I was living at home, so I got quite
nostalgic when the smells were filling my kitchen. It was also my first time
cooking with nutmeg, an interesting and tasty spice. This was a hearty dish,
perfect for enjoying in December!
